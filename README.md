# MCF8316A GUI with ESP8266

This project provides a simple and effective way to read and write MCF8316A motor driver registers using an ESP8266 microcontroller over I2C communication.

With this setup, you can easily configure and monitor the MCF8316A without needing a full microcontroller firmware redesign. Ideal for testing, tuning, and development purposes.
